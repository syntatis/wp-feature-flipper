> [!NOTE]  
> This plugin serves as a showcase for [Howdy](https://github.com/syntatis/howdy), a starter kit for develping a WordPressÂ® plugin that encourages modern development practices, and provides pre-configured tools for a more streamlined development experience.

WordPressÂ® has many features, some of which are useful and essential. However, there are likely some you donâ€™t need. This plugin makes it easy to turn certain features on or off, such as Comments, the Block Editor (Gutenberg), Emojis, Automatic Updates, Post Embeds, XML-RPC, REST API, and more.
